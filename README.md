# nighty-massping

This allows you to mass ping everybody using a custom script in a nighty client.
All pings will be deleted and it is a ghost pinger but it's designed to bypass Discord ping restrictions
Thanks to the key I was given a while back ago

# Installation instructions
- You need Nighty and the paid version of it
- Put it into your custom scripts folder
- Run command .mping <message to ping everyone will>
